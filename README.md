## Project Description
During my first semester, I looked into procedural generation and were fascinated of how it was set up.
Due to little knowledge, I tried to make a 2D pixel map generator for the "Visual Studio Terminal", making rules for water, sand, beach and trees to simulate a procedurally generated world.

<br>
The image and all colors in it can be changed to fit a deisred outcome.
